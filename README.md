# Combinations_Without_Repititions_Calculator
A calculator that takes in a number n between 0 and 20 and calculates a set of combinations from 0 to n.
The number of combinations is found by using the formula C(n,r)=n!/(r!(n-r)!).
This program will take in a number n and give the user the numbers C(n,0), C(n,1),..., C(n,n).
